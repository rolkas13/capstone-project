This project aims to design controller for servomechanism.

## Proposed mathematical model
![scheme](doc/images/math_scheme.PNG)

Equation 1:
$$
v(t) = Ri(t)+ K_e\omega(t) \\
J\dot{\omega}(t) = K_mi(t) - \beta\omega(t)-f_0*sgn(\omega) \\
$$
where: \
$v(t)$ - input voltage \
$i(t)$ - armature current \
$\omega(t)$ - angular velocity of the rotor \
$R$ - resistance of armature winding \
$J$ - moment of inertia of the moving parts \
$\beta$ - damping coefificient due to viscous friction \
$K_e\omega(t)$ - back EMF \
$K_mi(t)$ - electromechanical torque



## Sensors scaling

### Motor Encoder
Rotor of DC motor was rotated 10 times. Obtaning raw measurements gave us following results:
| Start position | Final position |
| - | - |
| -92.7568 | -155.4122 |

$$
(enc_f - enc_s)/ 10/ 2 =-3.1328
$$
The result is close to $\pi$. That meas that enccoer reading is already scaled to radians.

### Input Encoder
Absolute encoder, produces output with range [-99.11, 97.61]. Additional processing is neccessary for continous angle measurement.


### Tachometer
We have acquired data for steady state conditions for 5 given outputs. Then we compare tachometer and encoder outputs. Given below chart we have noticed that the tachometer output is already scaled to $rad/s$.

## Identification

### Motor Inertia

Given the datasheet parameter motor inertia is established as:

$J_M = 1.8 * 10^{-5}  [kg*m^2]$

### Motor torque constant

$$
k=5.3[\frac{mNm}{A}]=5.3*10^{-3}[\frac{V*s}{rad}]
$$
### Motor coil inductance

$L_M=1[mH]$

### Rotating mass inertia

Rotating mass has following dimensions and mass:

![alttext](doc/images/brass_inertia_load.PNG)

Inertia of the solid cylinder is given by the following equation:

$J_{SM}=\frac{1}{2}mr^2=1.1*10^{-3} [kg*m^2]$


### Resistance of the net
First of all we have mesure the voltage of idle DC motor. In order to accomplish this task we have disconnected the DC motor power supply and measure the voltage value which is given below:\
 $U=6.65 [V]$ 

Then after reconnecting the motor we have locked the motor and measure the current with help of current probe. The result is given below:\
$I=2.45 [A]$

Finally we have used well-known Ohm formula to calculate resistance of the net:

$$
R=U/I \\
R=6.65/2.45=2.71 [\Omega]
$$

### Friction

In order to identify damping coefficient we have followed equations:

$$ 
 v = Ri + k\omega \\
 ki = \beta\omega + f_0
$$
They have been derived from the mathematical model, taking into account that we examine the system in steady-state. \
$f_0$ - statci friction coefficient

After combining the equations, we have got:

$$
f_0 + \beta\omega = \frac{k}{R}v - \frac{k^2}{R}\omega
$$

The right side we have signed as RHS and on the left we have got linear function of $\omega$. Now, the task was to find the coefficients of the function. We have used the data from the experiment described above in 'Tachometer' part. 
After choosing 5 points, we have calculated RHS for appropriate values of v and $\omega$. Then we have used Basic Fitting tool to find the coefficients of the linear function.

We have got:

$$
f_0 = 1.8*10^{-3}  \\
\beta = 1.3*10^{-4}
$$

## Servo model

We have created folowing model of servo, according to Equation 1:

The comparison of acquired data and model gace the following results:

## Control algorith considerations

PID regulator can be implemented for control of plant. This method can be easily introduced as long as it require little knowledge of system dynamics.

### PID tuning

The following test stand was implemented to tune PID controller:

The results of PID tuning:

![pid_tune_res](doc/images/pid_tuning_result.png)

Transfer function of PID:
$$
G(s) = P + I \frac{1}{s} + D \frac{N}{1 + N\frac{1}{s}}
$$
Coefficents:
$$
P = 28 \\
I = 23 \\
D = 7.6 \\
N = 22.7 \\
$$
