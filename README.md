# Servomechanism control
## Capstone Project

This project aims to design controller for servomechanism.

## Proposed mathematical model

$$
v(t) = Ri(t)+ K_e\omega(t) \\
J\dot{\omega}(t) = K_mi(t) - \beta\omega(t) \\
$$

where:
## Sensors scaling

### Motor Encoder
Rotor of DC motor was rotated 10 times. Obtaning raw measurements gave us following results:
| Start position | Final position |
| - | - |
| -92.7568 | -155.4122 |

$$
(enc_f - enc_s)/ 10/ 2 =-3.1328
$$
The result is close to $\pi$. That meas that enccoer reading is already scaled to radians.

### Input Encoder
Absolute encoder, produces output with range [-99.11, 97.61]. Additional processing is neccessary for continous angle measurement.


### Tachometer
We have acquired data for steady state conditions for 5 given outputs.
